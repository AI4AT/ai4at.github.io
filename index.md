# Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Air Transportation (AI4AT)
**at the Fortieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26) in Singapore**

{% include figure.html img="workshop-logo.jpg" width="50%" %}

Academic, industrial, and governmental interest in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to air transportation has accelerated markedly in recent years, fueled by the urgent need to make aviation systems more efficient, resilient, and environmentally sustainable. The inaugural Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Air Transportation (AI4AT) will bring together researchers and practitioners to explore how AI can address pressing challenges across air traffic management, airport operations, advanced air mobility, and aviation safety. Held in conjunction with [AAAI-26](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-26/) in Singapore — a global hub for aviation innovation and regulatory leadership — AI4AT will provide a dynamic forum for interdisciplinary exchange and collaboration.

## Topics

The workshop will focus on a broad range of issues, including but not limited to:
 1. Air Traffic Management (ATM): AI-enabled solutions for improving air traffic control and optimizing airspace usage, crucial for handling growing flight volumes and increasingly complex weather patterns caused by climate change.
 2. Airport Operations: AI-enabled solutions for more efficient and smoother ground operations, to handle growing passenger numbers.
 3. Advanced Air Mobility (AAM): The use of AI for both vehicular autonomy and traffic management in the urban landscape.
 4. Aviation Safety: The use of AI for enhancing aviation safety, but also the role of trustworthy AI in a high-stakes application domain.

## Format & Attendance

This is a 1-day **non-archival** workshop featuring invited keynotes, spotlight talks, and a poster & networking session. All AAAI-26 attendees are welcome to participate. A total of **S$600 in prizes** will be awarded to the best spotlight and poster presentations.

## Submission Requirements

Extended abstracts of up to **2 pages (excluding references)**, using the AAAI-26 Author Kit. Submissions may be unpublished, in-progress, concurrently submitted, or recently published works.

Submissions will be managed on the OpenReview platform. Each submission will undergo a peer review process. Review criteria will include relevance to the workshop theme, technical soundness, originality, and potential to spark meaningful discussion during the workshop. Submissions and reviews will not be made public.

Please make your submissions [here](https://openreview.net/group?id=AAAI.org/2026/Workshop/AI4AT). Submissions should not be anonymized. ~~The submission deadline is October 22nd, 2025.~~ **Due to the recent OpenReview downtime, we're extending the submission deadline by 48 hours. The new deadline is October 24th, 2025 at 23:59 AoE (UTC−12).**
